- This is a simple application that makes use of the Google Maps API to find directions to some of my favorite routes. 
- Some of the favorite routes are: 
	1. Route to office
	2. Route to Starbucks near the office
	3. Route to one of my favorite restaurants

All these routes have the start location as that of my home.

- The idea was, since everytime, I have to lookup these routes on maps.google.com, before I leave, and these URLs are way too long to remember, I created shortened URLs using bitly.

- Using this application, I can add more favorites, so that I can have all my shortened URLs at one place. The app also displays the history of my routes.

- You can view a demo of the application at: http://bit.ly/maps27
	
- Github link for the code: https://github.com/naritapandhe/GoogleMaps

- I have not made the use of direct bitly libraries for Javascript, instead made calls using AJAX Get only.
